# Pathweaver Implementation Roadmap

## Development Strategy

**Conversational-First Approach**: Build a robust chat interface with LLM integration, then layer on game-specific features. Focus on the conversation experience rather than traditional game mechanics.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication (Week 1)
*Goal: Working web app with user auth and basic chat interface*

### Day 1-2: Project Setup
- [ ] Create Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS and basic styling
- [ ] Configure Supabase project and database
- [ ] Set up Netlify deployment pipeline (only Supabase env vars needed)

### Day 3-4: Authentication System
- [ ] Implement Supabase Auth integration
- [ ] Create login/signup forms
- [ ] Add protected routes and auth guards
- [ ] Basic user profile management

### Day 5-7: Basic Chat Interface
- [ ] Create chat message components
- [ ] Implement message list with scrolling
- [ ] Add message input with send functionality
- [ ] Basic message persistence to database

**Phase 1 Deliverable**: Users can sign up, log in, and send/receive messages in a chat interface

## Phase 2: LLM Integration (Week 2)
*Goal: Working LLM conversation with game master prompts*

### Day 8-9: LLM Configuration System
- [ ] Create LLM provider abstraction layer
- [ ] Implement OpenAI provider adapter

- [ ] Create LLM configuration UI

### Day 10-11: Game Master Integration
- [ ] Design game master system prompt
- [ ] Implement conversation context management
- [ ] Add LLM response handling and display
- [ ] Create typing indicators and loading states

### Day 12-14: Conversation Management
- [ ] Implement session save/load functionality
- [ ] Add conversation history management
- [ ] Create session list and management UI
- [ ] Add auto-save functionality

**Phase 2 Deliverable**: Users can configure their LLM, start conversations with the game master, and save/load sessions

## Phase 3: Game Features (Week 3)
*Goal: Enhanced game master capabilities and user experience*

### Day 15-16: Enhanced Game Master
- [ ] Refine game master prompts for storytelling
- [ ] Add character creation flow through conversation
- [ ] Implement story state tracking (minimal)
- [ ] Add game session metadata

### Day 17-18: Additional LLM Providers
- [ ] Implement Anthropic (Claude) provider
- [ ] Add model selection UI
- [ ] Create provider-specific configurations
- [ ] Add token usage tracking

### Day 19-21: User Experience Polish
- [ ] Improve chat UI with rich text formatting
- [ ] Add message timestamps and metadata
- [ ] Create better mobile responsive design
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility

**Phase 3 Deliverable**: Full-featured conversational game with multiple LLM providers and polished UX

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish (Week 4)
*Goal: Production-ready application with advanced features*

### Day 22-23: Advanced Chat Features
- [ ] Add message search functionality
- [ ] Implement conversation export/import
- [ ] Add conversation sharing (optional)
- [ ] Create conversation templates

### Day 24-25: Performance & Security
- [ ] Implement message pagination
- [ ] Add response streaming (if supported)
- [ ] Enhance security measures
- [ ] Add rate limiting and error handling

### Day 26-28: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Final deployment and monitoring setup
- [ ] User documentation and onboarding

**Phase 4 Deliverable**: Production-ready Pathweaver with all features implemented and tested

## Technical Milestones

### Milestone 1: "Chat Works" (Day 7)
- User authentication functional
- Basic chat interface operational
- Messages persist to database
- Responsive design working

### Milestone 2: "AI Responds" (Day 14)
- LLM integration working
- Game master responds to user input
- Conversation context maintained
- Sessions save and load properly

### Milestone 3: "Game Master Ready" (Day 21)
- Enhanced storytelling prompts
- Multiple LLM providers supported
- Rich conversation experience
- Mobile-friendly interface

### Milestone 4: "Production Ready" (Day 28)
- All features implemented and tested
- Performance optimized
- Security measures in place
- Documentation complete

## Database Migration Strategy

### Initial Schema (Phase 1)
```sql
-- Basic user configs and sessions
CREATE TABLE user_configs (...);
CREATE TABLE game_sessions (...);
```

### Enhanced Schema (Phase 2)
```sql
-- Add LLM provider fields
ALTER TABLE user_configs ADD COLUMN provider_settings JSONB;
```

### Final Schema (Phase 3)
```sql
-- Add advanced features
ALTER TABLE game_sessions ADD COLUMN session_metadata JSONB;
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_user_updated ON game_sessions(user_id, updated_at);
```

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **LLM API Reliability**: External API dependencies
   - *Mitigation*: Multiple provider support, error handling, fallback responses
2. **API Key Security**: Protecting user credentials
   - *Mitigation*: Client-side encryption, secure storage practices
3. **Token Costs**: Users may incur unexpected costs
   - *Mitigation*: Usage tracking, warnings, configurable limits

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Performance**: Large conversation histories
   - *Mitigation*: Pagination, message limits, optimization
2. **User Experience**: Complex LLM configuration
   - *Mitigation*: Simple defaults, guided setup, clear documentation

### Low-Risk Items
1. **Technical Implementation**: Well-understood web technologies
2. **Deployment**: Netlify provides reliable hosting
3. **Database**: Supabase handles scaling and reliability

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (End of Phase 2)
- [ ] User authentication and profile management
- [ ] LLM configuration with encrypted API key storage
- [ ] Working chat interface with game master
- [ ] Session persistence and management
- [ ] Basic responsive design

### Full Feature Set (End of Phase 4)
- [ ] Multiple LLM provider support
- [ ] Rich conversation experience with formatting
- [ ] Advanced session management features
- [ ] Mobile-optimized interface
- [ ] Performance optimization and security hardening
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase CLI for local development
- Netlify CLI for deployment testing
- VS Code with recommended extensions

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Only minimal environment variables needed
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# All LLM configuration handled through UI:
# - API keys configured by users in settings
# - Model selection through UI dropdowns  
# - All settings stored in user_configs table
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Core services and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: LLM provider integrations
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (auth, chat, save/load)
- **Manual Testing**: Conversation quality and user experience

### Quality Gates
- All tests pass before phase completion
- Security review for API key handling
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility compliance verified

This roadmap prioritizes getting a working conversational experience quickly, then enhancing it with game-specific features while maintaining focus on the chat-based interaction model.
